When incorporating stories and examples into your speech, it's important to use vivid details that help to bring the story to life. Use sensory language such as sight, sound, and smell to create a clear picture in your audience's mind. The more details you provide, the more engaging and memorable your story or example will be.

Tying Stories and Examples to Key Points

Incorporating stories and examples into your presentation is most effective when you tie them directly to your key points. Use your stories and examples to reinforce your main ideas and make them more memorable. Make it clear to your audience how the story or example relates to your message.

Avoiding Distractions
